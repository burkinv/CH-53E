This project (Sikorsky Ch53) was undertaken by FreddyStoned.

The EFM Flight Model was used from CptSmiley (F22Demo) and Nibbylots (AH6) models and 
crudely converted to the CH53 by FreddyStoned.

The original FlightGear Ch53 model was used (with kind permission) from the authors:
Pierre Duval, Josh Babcock, RedTwo, StuartC (FGUK), Voodoo da Vinci, and Richard Harrison.
